**General Queries**

* Surely there are better ways to document functions-take-options objects than just casting them as `:any`? In most cases the types are right there in the JSDoc but the TS ignores these types completely

Yes but this will take time to implement as you need to write declarations for each one, will be done eventually but any serves as a stopgap

* ... likewise with `@ts-ignore`. Isn't the idea that these shouldn't exist? The plugins/*.js files specifically are a pretty standard subclassing pattern which has been around since C++

This is mostly for your libraries which lack a declaration file and where I can't be bothered manually writing declarations for now

* ... also what is going on with `lib/syncro/syncro.ts#config` - setting types in one place and setting their defaults in another seems backwards

Its just typescript syntax, I have changed the flavour of that now so that it is typed where defined

* ... the same seems to apply with telling TS to ignore stuff with the exclaimation mark suffix

This is typescripts way of declaring that a variable will never be null or undefined

* `lib/terafy.server.ts#selectProjectLibrary()` appears to have renamed `filters` -> `filter`, breaking all this functionality. I've renamed it back. I'm a little confused why TS didn't pick up on this

If your refering to the `delete filter` line I have now removed that

* ... The function also seems to have been rewritten to catch errors but to silently dispose of errors... I'm sure I don't need to point out that not re-throwing errors as indicated here is harmful

I see it throwing the error so am unsure what you mean here: `if (!selectedFile || !selectedFile.id) throw new Error('Library selection failed or was cancelled.');` ***need clarification***

* Some blocks of code appear to have been rewriten so they don't have the same result e.g. `lib/terafy.server.ts#init()` in the JS version actually follows the JSDoc and returns the instance. This appears to have been stripped in the TS version so that the actual response from the function would be void.

This indeed does return void in the original terafy.server.ts#init() so am unsure what you are referencing here ***need clarification***

* Why is it necessary to cast self-evident objects e.g. `(this as any)` and `(console as any)`?

Because they are often not self evident at compile time and you need to manually specify any to do funky stuff with it. e.g.

* ... `(this as any)[message.method].apply(this, message.args as any[])` why?

Because message method is a string and can be anything. Therefore to keep typescript happy you either define `this as any` or define message.method well e.g. `message.method as 'setProjectLibrary' | 'getProjectLibrary'` so that it knows you are calling valid functions. At some point I plan on writing declaration files for client/server methods so that this becomes uncessasary and that the client and server both know exactly what functions/arguments are supported in RPC calls between them

* Changing the default value of `immediate` config property in `lib/syncro/syncro.ts#setHeartbeat` without also changing the JSDoc spec? Why is this change even needed?

Is not necessary, but is probably better to have it default false and only be true when its called from mount(). I have now patched this back to how it was.

* ... in the same function, returning the sub-promise of `heartbeat()` is logical but the JSdoc `@returns` is still omitted

JSDoc types can now be removed but as you mentioned earlier there are still some `any` that need to be ported over, so the JSDoc types are still there as a stopgap. The jsdoc type of `@returns {Promise} A promise which resolves when the operation has completed` is technically correct but it still is returning a `Promise<void>` so the TS declaration is more correct.

* ... in the same function, returning the sub-promise of `heartbeat()` is logical but the JSdoc `@returns` is still omitted
* Whatever LLM you are using seems very eagre to assume all promises are `void` returns. I started to document how many places this is flatly incorrect but gave up after a while. Nearly all of them.

Can I see an example? All the places I checked it usually is a returned promise that resolves as void

* `lib/terafy.server.ts#injectComms()` - `resolve()` -> `resolve(undefined)`. I'm glad we got that cleared up

Yes this is indeed a void promise return in the original

* `lib/tera-fy.server.js#getUserViaEmbedWorkaround` - Sorry but isn't Typescript supposed to figure out that localStorage can _ONLY_ return strings here?

I believe localStorage can return anything here

* `lib/tera-fy.server.js#createContext()` - This no longer appears to actually send messages (the `postMessage()` part has been completely removed), did you even test this?

I don't see this, I still see it using postMessage() `e.source as WindowProxy).postMessage(payload, this.settings.restrictOrigin);`

* `lib/tera-fy.server.js#setHeardbeat()` - This now seems to wait for a resulting heartbeat if its enabled which isn't part of the documented behaviour

Guessing you mean syncro not server. As far as I can see this functions the exact same just with an extra variable for readability

* `lib/tera-fy.server.js#senderRpc()` - seems to have changed its behaviour, no idea why it now needs to create a context before sending - maybe something to do with the change in `createContext()`?

To be honest I'm not sure why gemini made this change originally but heres its logic which checks out for me:
```
Original JS Problem:

senderRpc was called on a context object created earlier (likely inside acceptMessage). So, this.messageEvent inside senderRpc did correctly refer to the event associated with that context.

However, it then called this.send(). Because send was not defined on the context object by createContext, it used the send method inherited from the main TeraFyServer.prototype.

Inside that send method, this still referred to the contextObj. So, this.messageEvent was correct.

But, the call this.sendRaw(...) inside send also used the sendRaw inherited from TeraFyServer.prototype, not the specialized sendRaw defined on the context object by createContext. This means it might not have used the correct source window to send the message back, relying instead on globalThis.parent or whatever the default sendRaw targeted. The explicit passing of this.messageEvent.source as the second argument to this.sendRaw in the original send method likely saved it and made it appear to work correctly most of the time.

TypeScript Fix / Improvement:

The TS version makes the relationship explicit and safer.

It gets the correct this.messageEvent.

It explicitly creates the specific context for that event using this.createContext(this.messageEvent).

It calls context.send(...).

Now, when send (inherited from the prototype) executes, this correctly refers to context.

Crucially, when send calls this.sendRaw(...), it now calls the sendRaw that was specifically defined on the context by createContext, ensuring the message goes back to the correct e.source via the context-specific sendRaw.
```

* `lib/tera-fy.server.js#acceptMessage()` - Pretty sure just dropping messages that dont expect a response is the wrong thing to do here, what if the downstream returns void OR something and the upstream is watiing on that?

Correct but this was fixed before you left - guessing you didn't pull the latest version before getting on the plane

* `lib/tera-fy.server.js#emitClients()` - The nature of this function has changed from 'wait for send to complete' to always resolving

From your JSDoc comment:
`Note that emitted messages have no response - they are sent to clients only with no return value`. Therefore why would you wait for the send to complete? I have reverted this back to the original logic just in case however

* `lib/tera-fy.server.js#setProjectStateDefaults()` - Why does `actualValue` need declaring, what is its purpose?

At least for me it makes the logic more clear and because it is later reassigned which shouldn't be done for passed parameters

* `lib/tera-fy.server.js#selectProjectFile()` `settings.allowCancel && ['cancel'],` vs. `settings.allowCancel ? ['cancel'] : []` are not the same thing

```
TypeScript encourages consistent data types. The buttons option is fundamentally meant to hold a list of buttons.

In TS, it's much cleaner and more type-safe if the buttons property always expects an array type (e.g., string[] or ButtonDefinition[]).

Providing an empty array ([]) when no buttons are needed fulfills the requirement of providing an array, while semantically representing "no buttons". A loop iterating over [] simply does nothing, which is the desired outcome.

Providing false would mean the type signature for buttons would have to be something like string[] | ButtonDefinition[] | false, which is slightly more complex and less idiomatic for representing a list.
